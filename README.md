Real-Time AI-Powered Sentiment and Propaganda Analysis in Broadcast Media 
Misinformation and biased reporting erode public trust in media. Live broadcasts, due to their dynamic 
nature, pose a significant challenge in monitoring and ensuring balanced reporting. Currently, there are 
limited tools available to identify and address emotional manipulation, biased language, and 
propaganda in real-time. 
This project addresses the critical need for a system that empowers broadcasters with immediate 
feedback, ensuring transparency, minimizing bias, and promoting fact-based journalism.
